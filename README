Each git commit goes along with some milestone reached in the tutorial
(finishing a lesson, but also some other ones reached at half a lesson
too). Therefore you can log and diff so as to look at the evolution of
the game along with the tutorial.

There are tag marks for the code at the end of each lesson too.

Also, there are some branches, which include modifications to the
code, including the extras at the tutorial
